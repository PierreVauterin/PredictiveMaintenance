# PredictiveMaintenance
Discovering the concept of predictive maintenance using Python

This notebook has been written during my second internship. I used a Kaggle dataset (available for import as long as you have a kaggle api key) to test several predictive maintenance concepts.

I tested multiple machine learning algorithms, such as regression, to determine the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of the engines, some classifications algorithms (SVMs and logistic regressions) to visualize anomalies in the engines behaviours, and I also tested some small neural networks (LSTMs, RNNs and CNNs) to check if the engines will encounter a critical failures in the following X use cycles.
